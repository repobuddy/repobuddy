# CR: backfill the `repobuddy` project spec

Open a project spec for `packages/buddy` (package name **`repobuddy`**, the clibuilder CLI).
No source CR — a bare prompt.

## Decisions (settled, do not relitigate)

- **Scope**: `packages/buddy` only. Not the outer repo, not the other 5 packages.
- **Coverage**: as-intended. Detection mode for the existing shell, intent mode for the
  unbuilt `init` / `add` commands. The spec drives the build.
- **Strategy**: capability-first. `check-partition-quality` declined to decide
  (top-folder: "history too thin — 8 usable multi-file commits, floor 20"; role: 33.3%
  parallelizable but shuffled control 81.4%, so the margin is noise).
- **Location**: colocated at `packages/buddy/.agents/spec/`. The package `files` array is
  an allowlist (`esm`, `template`, `src`) so `.agents/` is excluded from the tarball —
  no hoist needed.
- **Name frontmatter**: must declare `name: repobuddy`. `discover-specs` would guess the
  folder basename `buddy`, which is wrong.

### Seed intent (grilled 2026-08-11, settled)

- **`init`** = config + detection + templates, idempotent. Writes `.repobuddy.json`,
  pre-populates `plugins` from installed deps, copies `templates/*` into the repo, and
  merges rather than overwrites/errors on re-run. Requires fixing the `files` allowlist
  typo `"template"` → `"templates"`.
- **`add <plugin>`** = install **and** register. Shells the detected package manager to
  add the dep, then appends it to `plugins` in the config.
- **Namespace**: literal package names only, **no `@repobuddy/` shorthand**. The readme's
  `buddy add <plugin>` → `@repobuddy/<plugin>` line is wrong and is corrected by this
  mission's implementation.
- **Non-goals: none.** The user declined every proposed exclusion, so all four are
  in scope for the spec: the `plugins` list/search command, the plugin authoring
  contract, `remove` / `update` commands, and config schema validation.

## State of the code (as read)

- `src/app.ts` — `cli({ name: 'repobuddy', version, description, config: true })`. No
  commands registered. No `keywords` **option passed to `cli()`** (package.json does have
  a `keywords` field — different thing).
- `src/bin.ts` — `app.parse(process.argv)`.
- `src/app.spec.ts` — one assertion: `app.version` matches `package.json`.
- readme lists `buddy init` and `buddy add <plugin>` as 🚧 — neither is built.
- `package.json` `files` ships `template/`; the directory on disk is `templates/`
  (holding one `.editorconfig`). Typo in the allowlist — the templates are currently
  **not shipped**. Fixing it is in this mission's scope.

## clibuilder v9 facts that constrain the spec

- `config: true` + `name: repobuddy` resolves `repobuddy{,.json,.yml,rc,...}` and the
  dotted `.repobuddy.*` variants via find-up, plus a `repobuddy` key in `package.json`.
  So `.repobuddy.json` is already supported — the readme is not wrong.
- Plugins listed in `config.plugins` are **auto-loaded** by clibuilder. Plugin loading is
  already free; buddy needs no code for it.
- A `plugins` command (list / search by keyword) is auto-added when `config` or
  `keywords` is set. Search uses `findByKeywords`, so buddy's missing `keywords` makes
  search matchless.
- `@repobuddy/typescript` is already a working plugin: exports `activate(ctx)`, registers
  a `ts` command with `build` + `copyCJSPackageJson`. Its keywords include `repobuddy`.

## NEXT

Scaffold the spec envelope at `packages/buddy/.agents/spec/` (frontmatter must carry
`name: repobuddy`), then author the node spec + `.feature` against the seed intent above.

Open (non-blocking, assume unless told otherwise): `init`'s template-copy conflict
behavior — assumed **skip existing files and report them**, no overwrite without an
explicit force flag. Confirm at the spec gate.
