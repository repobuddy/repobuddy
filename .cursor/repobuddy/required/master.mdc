# Cursor Rules Master Reference

This file serves as the central reference for all Cursor rules in the repository.

## Available Rules

All rules should be located under folders `.cursor/rules`.
They can be placed at the root of the repository (i.e. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`),
or under the root of a project in a monorepo (e.g. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/packages/<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`).

Other `*.mdc` files should not be treated as rule files unless referenced explicitly.
