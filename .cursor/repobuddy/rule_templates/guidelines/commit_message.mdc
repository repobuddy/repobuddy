# Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages in this repository must follow the Conventional Commits specification.

This rule should be used when generating commit messages.

## CRITICAL: Staged Changes Take Absolute Priority

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST follow this order exactly:**

1. **ALWAYS check staged changes FIRST** with `git status --porcelain`
2. **If staged changes exist**: Use `git diff --cached` to analyze the changes for commit message generation
3. **NEVER look at unstaged changes** when there are staged changes
4. **Only check unstaged changes** if there are NO staged changes

**This is a strict requirement - staged changes completely override unstaged changes for commit message generation.**

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **FIRST: Check for staged changes**:
   - Use `git status --porcelain` to efficiently detect if staged changes exist
   - **If there ARE staged changes**: Use `git diff --cached` to analyze the staged changes and ignore unstaged changes
   - **If there are NO staged changes**: Then check unstaged changes with `git diff`

2. **Write your commit message in the following format**:

	```
	<type>[optional scope]: <description>

	[optional body]

	[optional footer(s)]
	```

3. **Choose the appropriate type**:
   - `feat`: New features
   - `fix`: Bug fixes
   - `docs`: Documentation changes, including add or update stories
   - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Build process, tooling, or configuration changes
   - `perf`: Performance improvements

4. **Add scope when helpful** (e.g., `chore(rules)`, `fix(auth)`, `docs(api)`)

5. **Write a clear description** that explains the purpose, not just what changed

6. **Add body for complex changes** with additional context or breaking change notes

## Examples

### Simple fix

```text
fix(component): resolve button hover state not working in dark mode
```

### Feature with body

```text
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint

Implements JWT-based authentication for user login with proper error handling and validation.

BREAKING CHANGE: The login endpoint now requires a password field.
```

### Configuration change

```text
chore: update TypeScript configuration for stricter type checking
```

## Special Cases

- **Cursor rules only**: If changes are only in `.cursor/rules`, `.github`, or `.vscode` folders, always use `chore` type
- **Cursor rules scope**: When changing cursor rules (files in `.cursor/rules`), use `chore(rules)` as the type and scope
- **Breaking changes**: Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body
- **Configuration changes**: Use `chore` type for config files, build tools, etc.
- **Multiple unrelated changes**: Consider splitting into multiple commits or use a general type like `chore`
