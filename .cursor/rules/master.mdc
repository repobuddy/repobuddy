# Cursor Rules Master Reference

This file serves as the central reference for all Cursor rules in the repository.

## Available Rules

All rules should be located under folders `.cursor/rules`.
They can be placed at the root of the repository (i.e. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`),
or under the root of a project in a monorepo (e.g. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/packages/<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`).

Other `*.mdc` files should not be treated as rule files unless referenced explicitly.

### Agents

Rules for AI agent behavior and management:

- @agents/cursor_rules.mdc - Guidelines for cursor rules in this repository
- @agents/commit_summary.mdc - Add a "Commit Message" section in agent response
- @agents/rule_usage.mdc - Add a "Rules Applied" section in agent response

### Guidelines

Opinionated best practices on specific topics:

- @guidelines/commit_message.mdc - Commit message formatting and conventions
- @guidelines/markdown.mdc - Markdown formatting standards and best practices

## How to Use Rules
