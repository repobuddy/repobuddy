# Commit Summary Instructions

This rule ensures a commit message is generated when you summarize code changes.

## When to Apply This Rule

This rule should be applied in EVERY response involving code changes.

## Commit Message Generation Process

Follow [commit_message.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit_message.mdc) to generate the commit message.

## Response Format

When generating a commit message, place the commit message within a text code block:

```text
[generated commit message]
```

## Examples

For reference, see these specific examples:
- **Component Creation**: [component_creation.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/component_creation.md) - Shows feature addition with detailed body
- **Bug Fix**: [bug_fix.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/bug_fix.md) - Shows fix type with bullet points in body
- **Documentation Update**: [doc_update.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/doc_update.md) - Shows docs type with multiple changes

## Enforcement

**This rule is MANDATORY - no exceptions.** If you forget to apply this rule:

1. The user may point out the oversight
2. You must immediately generate the commit message
3. Acknowledge the rule was missed and explain why it should have been applied

## Integration with Existing Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- [commit_message.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit_message.mdc) - For commit message format and conventions
- [master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/master.mdc) - For overall rule organization
- [rule_usage.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chat_behaviors/rule_usage.mdc) - For documenting rule application
