# Commit Summary Instructions

This rule ensures a commit message is generated when you summarize code changes.

## When to Apply This Rule

This rule should be applied in EVERY response involving code changes.

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[generate_commit_message.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commands/generate_commit_message.mdc)**: For commit message format and conventions that must be followed
- **[master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/master.mdc)**: For overall rule organization that must be understood
- **[rule_usage.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/rule_usage.mdc)**: For documenting rule application that must be applied

## Commit Message Generation Process

Follow [generate_commit_message.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commands/generate_commit_message.mdc) to generate the commit message.

## Response Format

When generating a commit message, place the commit message within a text code block:

```text
[generated commit message]
```

## Examples

For reference, see these specific examples:

- **Component Creation**: [component_creation.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/component_creation.md) - Shows feature addition with detailed body
- **Bug Fix**: [bug_fix.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/bug_fix.md) - Shows fix type with bullet points in body
- **Documentation Update**: [doc_update.md](mdc:.cursor/examples/commit_message/doc_update.md) - Shows docs type with multiple changes

## Enforcement

1. The user may point out the oversight
2. You must immediately generate the commit message
3. Acknowledge the rule was missed and explain why it should have been applied
