# Scaffold Cursor Rules - Step by Step Workflow

This workflow will set up or migrate the Cursor rules to meet the lastest best practices.

## Workflow Steps

### Prerequiste Check

If the folder `.cursor/backup` exist, terminate the whole workflow **IMMEDIATELY**.

### Backup Existing Rules

If the folder `.curser/rules` exist, move it to `.cursor/backup`.

### Copy Example Files

Copy the examples in `.cursor/scaffold/examples` to `.cursor/examples`.
Skip file if it already exists.

### Copy Basic Rules

- Copy `.cursor/scaffold/rule_templates/master.mdc` to `.cursor/rules`
- Copy all files under `.cursor/scaffold/rule_templates/agents` to `.cursor/rules/agents`

### Adjust file name convention

- Look for file and folder naming convention rule under the `.cursor/backup` folder.
- If found, check and update the the rules in `.cursor/rules` to make them conform with the convention.
  - This includes renaming the rules and updating their content.

### Setup Markdown Guidelines

- Check if there is a markdown guideline rule under `.cursor/backup`.
- If there is, migrate it to `.cursor/rules` following the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/cursor_rules.mdc`.
- It not, copy `.cursor/rules/scaffold/rule_templates/guidelines/markdown.mdc` to `.cursor/rules/guidelines`
- Check if the repository uses any markdown related tools, add adjust the rule based on the config found.

### Setup Commit Message Guidelines

- Check if there is a commit message guideline rule under `.cursor/backup`.
- If there is, migrate it to `.cursor/rules` following the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/cursor_rules.mdc`.
- It not, copy `.cursor/rules/scaffold/rule_templates/guidelines/commit_message.mdc` to `.cursor/rules/guidelines`
- Check if the repository uses any commit message related tools, add adjust the rule based on the config found.

### Migrate Backed Up Rules

For each rule in `.cursor/backup`:

- Identify its category according to the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/cursor_rules.mdc`
- If a similar rule already exist in `.cursor/rules` or its subfolder, skip this rule.
- Copy the rule to the corresponding subfolder under `.cursor/rules` according to the category.
- Update the copied rule according to the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/cursor_rules.mdc`.

At the end, list the which rule you have migrated or skipped.
Indicate where the rule is migrated to.

### Update Rule References

Follow the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/cursor_rules.mdc` to update the rule references in the `.cursor/rules` folder.

### Describe next steps

- Follow the rule `.cursor/rules/agents/commit_summary.mdc` to generate a commit message.
- Remind me that the `.cursor/backup` contains the original rules.
- Ask me that if the new rules looks good, and do I want you to delete that folder.
